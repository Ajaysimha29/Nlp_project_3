Text Summarization and Classification Pipeline
This project aims to evaluate the impact of text summarization on classification tasks by comparing the results of classifiers using both the original and summarized text as input. The pipeline involves two summarization models and two classification models, followed by a comparison of their performance.

Overview
Workflow
Input Text: The process starts with a text document as input.
Text Summarization:
The text is summarized using two different models:
Model 1: Summarization Model A
Model 3: Summarization Model B
Text Classification:
The summarized text is passed to classification models:
Model 2: Classifier for Model 1's output
Model 4: Classifier for Model 3's output
For comparison, the original text is also classified using the same classification models.
Comparison of Results:
The results of classification on summarized text are compared with the results from the original text to evaluate performance differences.
Project Structure
Summarization Models:

Model 1: [Insert summarization model details, e.g., BART, T5, etc.]
Model 3: [Insert summarization model details, e.g., Pegasus, GPT, etc.]
Classification Models:

Model 2: [Insert classification model details, e.g., BERT, XGBoost, etc.]
Model 4: [Insert classification model details, e.g., Logistic Regression, etc.]
Comparison:

Metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and precision are used to compare the classification results.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Install the required libraries
Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: The requirements.txt file should list all necessary packages, such as transformers, sklearn, nltk, etc.

How to Run

Prepare the dataset:

Place your dataset in the data/ directory.
Ensure the dataset format matches the expected input for the pipeline.
Run the pipeline:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Results:

Outputs and comparison metrics will be saved in the results/ directory.
Use Case
Dataset: WIKITEXT DATASET
Goal: Determine how summarization impacts sentiment analysis or text categorization tasks.

Observations:
Summarization impact on classification accuracy.
Model comparison based on summarization approach.
Future Work
Extend the pipeline to include more summarization and classification models.
Experiment with different types of datasets (legal, medical, etc.).
Evaluate other metrics, such as inference time and computational efficiency.
